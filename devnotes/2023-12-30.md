I started this project on Wednesday, 2023-12-27.  Up through today, I:

- Added a minimal `Pen` as a `GraphicsContext` wrapper
    - Includes wrapped `GraphicsContext` methods needed to date.
    - Includes type converters, bounds computations, etc., as needed.
- Added `Stencil`, with the following helpers
    - Styles and style maps (for use by clients)
    - Shapes: Labels, Rectangles
    - A notion of drawings
    - `StencilBuffer` to produce and save JavaFX images from drawings
    - A slightly different DSL than I used for `Mage` at work.
        - It isn't necessary to define all shapes as part of the `Stencil` system.
- `TclEngine`, with helpers
    - `Argq`, the argument queue type.
    - `TclEngineCommand`, which calls a method `cmd(TclEngine,Argq)`
    - `TclEnsemble`
    - Helper methods for argument processing, result handling, error handling, and type  conversions. 
- `StencilExtension`, a `TclEngine` binding for `Stencil`
    - Including `stencil style *` and `stencil test` only.
-  A "tool application" framework
- The `pen` app, with minimal tool implementations
    - `demo`, the `Stencil` demo/test app
    - `view`, which executes a `stencil` script and displays the result
    - `draw`, which executes a `stencil` script and saves the image as a PNG file
