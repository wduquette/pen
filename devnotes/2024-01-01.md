Today I added font support to `Stencil` and its Tcl extension.

- Added `PenFont`, wrapping JavaFX's `Font`
    - `PenFonts` remember their client-assigned symbolic name, weight, posture, and the family used at creation time.
    - JavaFX `Fonts` tell you the details of the font to which the requested font was mapped, which will pretty much always be different.
    - `PenFont` is much better proportioned for use with `StencilExtension`, and loses us no features.
- Added `PenFontMap`, for use by `StencilExtension`.
- Added the `font *` ensemble to `StencilExtension`
- Added proper `-font` handling to the relevant `stencil *` commands.
- Fleshed out the `PenFont` and `PenFontMap` javadoc.
- Added `Pen::clear(Paint)`, `Stencil::clear(Paint)`, and `stencil clear ?paint?`
- Improved `pen draw`'s error message on script error.
    - Includes file name, line number, and "errorInfo".
