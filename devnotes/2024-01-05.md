Today I:

- Added `margin`, `minWidth`, and `minHeight` as Stencil parameters.
- Added a `getImageSize()` method that uses the drawing bounds, margin, and minimum size to determine how big the finished image should be.
- Modified `StencilBuffer` to use it, removing `StencilBuffer::margin`
- Added `stencil cget` and `stencil configure` commands with these parameters.
- Did some cleanup in `StencilExtension`
