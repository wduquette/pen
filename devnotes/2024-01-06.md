- Defined the `Tack` type, as an equivalent to `Pos` but omitting the `BASELINE_*` options, which I don't use.
    - `Tack.NORTH`, etc.
- Defined `StencilBoundedShape`, which manages `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, and `tack`
    - Abstract based class for most shapes.
- Modified `StencilRect` to be a `StencilBoundedShape`
    - It's now basically a `draw` method.
- Modified `StencilLabel` to use `Tack` instead of `Pos`.
- Updated the `StencilExtension` and tests accordingly.
- Created a small version of `jtcl-2.8.0.jar` that includes only Tcl itself.
    - Delete `org/`, `tjc/`, and `tck/pkg`
    - Edit `tcl/lang/library/init.tcl` to exclude `tcllib` and `jtcllib`.
- It appears to do everything I need, and it's MUCH smaller.
