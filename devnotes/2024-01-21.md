- Yesterday:
    - I sat down and thought hard about the [[Stencil Class Hierarchy]]
    - And then revised it according.  See [[Stencil Design]].
- Today
    - I added `ContentShape`, an abstract base class for shapes whose size is determined by their content.
    - I added `BoxedTextShape`, the first `ContentShape`.
