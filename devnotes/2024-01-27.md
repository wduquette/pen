- Added the `Tool` interface and `FXTool` base class to `pen.tools`
    - They support better standard error handling for `ToolExceptions` and all uncaught `Throwables`.
    - In time, I'll add other features.
- Updated the existing tools to use them.
- Scrubbed the existing tools and began adding helpers to `Tool` and `ToolInfo`.
    - `printHelp`, `printUsage`, etc.
