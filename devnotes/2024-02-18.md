Two days ago:

- I updated `FundamentalCalendar`
    - To include an optional weekly cycle
    - To be a normal class built with a builder, rather than a record

Yesterday,

- I updated `SimpleCalendar`
    - To include an optional weekly cycle
    - To be a normal class rather than a record.
- Added many helpers to `Calendar`, `YearMonthDay`, and `PenFont`
- Extended `Calendar` so that it can expose weeks and months if they are available.
- Added a `Stencil` demo to `DemoTool` to draw a month spread for a given calendar month.
- Added the `MonthSpread` shape, a `ContentShape`, to draw a month spread for a given month in a given calendar.

Today,

- I revised `ContentShape` to support both expanding and non-expanding shapes.
    - And updated `BoxedTextShape` and `MonthSpread` accordingly.
- Added the preliminary `YearSpread`.
- Fixed a bug in `MonthSpread`.
