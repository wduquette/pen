For purposes of queries, it might be interesting to use some kind of entity ontology in a history file.  I.e., give me all the companies in a given region.

It's not at all clear what form this should take

- Ontology tree
- Tags
- Major type (from tree) with tags for nuances

Nor how detailed an ontology is of interest.
