Drawings often include labeled boxes even without using a full-fledged block diagram tool.  It would be convenient to allow `StencilLabel` to have the following:

- A `pad`, in pixels, that defaults to 0.
- A `foreground` color that defaults to `TRANSPARENT`
- A `background` color that defaults to `TRANSPARENT`

Then, it would be easy to draw boxed labels just by setting the style.
