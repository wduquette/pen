At present an incident knows the entities that are directly concerned in the incident.

It might be interesting to also retain the entities that are, um, *incidentally* related to the incident, e.g., characters that are mentioned in a scene but don't play a significant role.

As a more general notion, it might be interesting just how entities are related to incidents; this is another thing that could be the basis for queries.
