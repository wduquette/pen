A *regnal calendar* shares the weekly cycle of days and the yearly cycle of months with a more general calendar, but only applies from a given start date, which is also the new year, e.g., the years as reckoned from the coronation of King So-and-So. 

A regnal calendar has a start date and (ultimately) an end date. Fundamental days prior to the regnal epoch have no representation in the regnal calendar; and days following the coronation of the next king would be represented in the new monarch's calendar.

But determining the end date of a regnal calendar requires knowing the start date of the subsequent calendar.  Thus, for implementation purposes a regnal calendar is a half-line starting at the given start date and running indefinitely far into the future.
