    - [x] Armorican Calendar
    - [x] Fix bug in `day2yearDay`/`yearDay2day`.
    - [x] Convert `Calendar` to an abstract base class.
    - [ ] Consider replacing `Calendar.MonthRecord` with `CalendarMonth`, a month record that includes both the name data and the length.

    - [ ] ScrollingCanvasPane widget
    - [ ] Prototype timeline charts.
    - [ ] Review and cleanup `MonthSpread` and `YearSpread`
- Diagrams
    - [[Time Line Diagrams]]
        - [x] Flesh out `FundamentalCalendar`
        - [x] Add `SimpleCalendar`
        - [ ] Define a `TimeLineDiagram` class
        - [ ] Prototype a simple Time Line Diagram using Stencil
            - Add capabilities to Stencil as needed.
        - [ ] Add calendar definition and conversion Tcl extension
        - [ ] Add tool to define and output month and year calendars
        - [ ] Implement [[Regnal Calendars]]
    - [ ] Tree Diagram
- [ ] `pen` Application
    -   calendar tool
        - [ ] Basic tool, for exercising Calendar scripts
    -  `draw` tool
        - [ ] Execute multiple Tcl scripts, save PNG files
    - `view` tool
        - [x] Executes Tcl script, shows drawing
        - [ ] `pen view` tool displays the script text
        - [ ] Display read/eval errors in GUI, side by side with image.
    - `demo` tool
        - [x] Current test app runs as `pen demo`
        - [x] Pick from drawings done with Java API
    - [ ] Proper installation
    - [ ] `shell` tool â€” stretch goal
        - JTcl shell, for general Stencil scripting.
        - Might need to define `stencil` objects.
- `Pen` 
    - Add remaining `GraphicsContext` methods, as needed.
    - [ ] Line types (dash, dot, solid, at least)
- `Stencil` 
    - [x] Save, restore, and transforms
    - [ ] Explicit background, used when clearing.  Defaults to white.
    - [ ] Shapes
        - [x] Arrowheads
        - [ ] Polygons
        - [ ] Rounded rectangles
    - [ ] Position support for relevant shapes
- [ ] Tcl bindings
    - Update `stencil` for `Stencil` class, as features are added.
        - [x] Add `stencil save` and `stencil restore`
        - [ ] Add `stencil boxedtext` command.
    - [ ] `pen` for `Pen` class 
    - Enum commands?
- JTcl
    - Add helpers as needed by bindings.
    - [ ] Fork JTcl and simplify (it's too darn big!)
        - [x] Create minimal .jar by hand, to assess actual size
        - [x] Run with it awhile, make sure it works.
