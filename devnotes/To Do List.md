    - Review Javadoc
- Next Steps
    - [x] Give stencil an explicit background, used when clearing.  Defaults to white.
    - [x] Revise shape class hierarchy
    - [x] Add `ContentShape`.
    - [x] Add `BoxedTextShape`
    - [x] Add better tool framework
        - [x] Define `Tool`/`FXTool`, with error handling
        - [x] Convert existing tools to be `FXTools`
        - [x] `App` doesn't remove the tool name from the command line given to the tool.  It should
        - [x] Scrub the existing tools and add relevant helpers to `Tool`.
    - [ ] Fix `StencilException` installation.
        - It's clunky at present; see `ViewTool` and `DrawTool`.
        - `TclEngine` should remember the extensions and if needed unload them.
    - [ ] Add `StencilOval`.
    - [ ] Add `StencilCircle` plus `Pen` infrastructure
    - [ ] Use `.pen` file type for `Pen` drawing scripts
    - [ ] Add GUI to `pen view` so I can browse from a list of drawing scripts.
    - [ ] `pen view` tool displays script error in a useful way.
- [ ] `pen` Application
    - Refined tool architecture
        - Tool interface and base classes
        - Handling of all uncaught exceptions
    -  `draw` tool
        - [ ] Execute multiple Tcl scripts, save PNG files
    - `view` tool
        - [x] Executes Tcl script, shows drawing
        - [ ] Display read/eval errors in GUI, side by side with image.
        - [ ] Support browsing a list of Tcl scripts
    - `demo` tool
        - [x] Current test app runs as `pen demo`
        - [x] Pick from drawings done with Java API
    - [ ] Proper installation
    - [ ] `shell` tool â€” stretch goal
        - JTcl shell, for general Stencil scripting.
        - Might need to define `stencil` objects.
- `Pen` 
    - Add remaining `GraphicsContext` methods, as needed.
    - [ ] Line types (dash, dot, solid, at least)
- `Stencil` 
    - [ ] Explicit background, used when clearing.  Defaults to white.
    - [ ] Shapes
        - [x] Arrowheads
        - [ ] Polygons
        - [ ] Rounded rectangles
    - [ ] Position support for relevant shapes
- [ ] Tcl bindings
    - Update `stencil` for `Stencil` class, as features are added.
    - [ ] `pen` for `Pen` class 
    - Enum commands?
- JTcl
    - Add helpers as needed by bindings.
    - [ ] Fork JTcl and simplify (it's too darn big!)
        - [x] Create minimal .jar by hand, to assess actual size
        - [x] Run with it awhile, make sure it works.
