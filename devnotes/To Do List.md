- Any time
    - Review Javadoc
- Next Steps
    - [x] ScrollingCanvasPane widget
    - [x] Calendar Tool prototype
    - [x] Prototype timeline charts.
    - [x] Flesh out `HistoryBank`/`HistoryQuery`/`HistoryView`
    - [x] Test `HistoryQuery`
    - [x] Implement save/restore format for `History`
        - Use Tcl for now, but eventually we will want some XML processing.
        - Or, multi-table CSV? I think I have some CSV code in the Destiny project.
    - [x] Define API for loading history files, calendars, etc. without requiring all the APIs to be in the same shell.
    - [x] Add `pen history` for querying histories and producing Unicode timeline charts.
    - HistoryExtension Improvements
        - [ ] Allow the entities associated with an event to be a single list argument.
    - [ ] TextTimelineChart improvements
        - [ ] Complete box around periods.
        - [ ] Use "heavy" lines for when drawing periods, light lines for everything else.
        - [ ] Grouping of entities by type.
    - [ ] Revise TimelineDiagram to display `History` data
        - [ ] Will require `HistoryExtension`
            - [ ] Build histories in Tcl
            - [ ] Load history file
    - [ ] Review and cleanup `MonthSpread` and `YearSpread`
- Diagrams
    - [[Timeline Diagram Initial Concept]]
        - [x] Flesh out `FundamentalCalendar`
        - [x] Add `SimpleCalendar`
        - [x] Define a preliminary `TimeLineDiagram` class
        - [x] Prototype a simple Time Line Diagram using Stencil
            - Add capabilities to Stencil as needed.
        - [x] Design `HistoryBase` data class
        - [x] Prototype text timeline diagram output using Unicode drawing characters.
        - [x] Draw text timeline charts with "fuzzy" SOFT caps
            - Draw SOFT caps one row up from top or down from bottom.
            - If there are SOFT caps in the top or bottom row, leave room.
            - Also, fix c0 setting; it's one too small when we're drawing the periods.
        - [ ] Add querying and filtering to `HistoryBase`, per [[HistoryBank and HistoryQuery]]
        - [ ] Implement `HistoryExtension` for defining histories in Tcl.
        - [ ] Add `pen history` tool for querying histories and converting them to text timeline diagrams.
    - Calendar Charts
        - [ ] Add calendar definition and conversion Tcl extension
        - [ ] Add tool to define and output month and year calendars
        - [ ] Implement [[Regnal Calendars]]
    - [ ] Tree Diagram
- [ ] `pen` Application
    -   calendar tool
        - [ ] Basic tool, for exercising Calendar scripts
    -  `draw` tool
        - [ ] Execute multiple Tcl scripts, save PNG files
    - `view` tool
        - [x] Executes Tcl script, shows drawing
        - [ ] `pen view` tool displays the script text
        - [ ] Display read/eval errors in GUI, side by side with image.
    - `demo` tool
        - [x] Current test app runs as `pen demo`
        - [x] Pick from drawings done with Java API
    - [ ] Proper installation
    - [ ] `shell` tool â€” stretch goal
        - JTcl shell, for general Stencil scripting.
        - Might need to define `stencil` objects.
- `Pen` 
    - Add remaining `GraphicsContext` methods, as needed.
    - [ ] Line types (dash, dot, solid, at least)
- `Stencil` 
    - [x] Save, restore, and transforms
    - [ ] Explicit background, used when clearing.  Defaults to white.
    - [ ] Shapes
        - [x] Arrowheads
        - [ ] Polygons
        - [ ] Rounded rectangles
    - [ ] Position support for relevant shapes
- [ ] Tcl bindings
    - Update `stencil` for `Stencil` class, as features are added.
        - [x] Add `stencil save` and `stencil restore`
        - [ ] Add `stencil boxedtext` command.
    - [ ] `pen` for `Pen` class 
    - Enum commands?
- JTcl
    - Add helpers as needed by bindings.
    - [ ] Fork JTcl and simplify (it's too darn big!)
        - [x] Create minimal .jar by hand, to assess actual size
        - [x] Run with it awhile, make sure it works.
