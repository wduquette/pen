- Any time
    - Review Javadoc
- Next Steps
    - [x] Add `Stencil::getImageSize()` and `Stencil::setMargin`
        - See [[Stencil Margin]]
    - [x] Add `tack` parameter to `Stencil::rect`
    - [ ] Add GUI to `pen demo` so that I can browse from a list of different test drawings.
    - [ ] Add `StencilCircle` plus `Pen` infrastructure
    - [ ] `view` tool displays script error in a useful way.
    - [ ] Add transforms to `Pen`: translate, rotate, and (possibly) scale
    - [ ] Add transforms to `Stencil`
        - [ ] `Stencil::draw()` must transform bounds according to the current transform.
    - [ ] Add arrowheads.
        - [ ] Circles can be drawn centered on point or tangent to point.
- [ ] `pen` Application
    -  `draw` tool
        - [ ] Execute multiple Tcl scripts, save PNG files
    - `view` tool
        - [x] Executes Tcl script, shows drawing
        - [ ] Display read/eval errors in GUI, side by side with image.
        - [ ] Support browsing a list of Tcl scripts
    - `demo` tool
        - [x] Current test app runs as `pen demo`
        - [ ] Pick from drawings done with Java API
            - [ ] Or, possible, from example scripts.
    - [ ] Proper installation
    - [ ] `shell` tool â€” stretch goal
        - JTcl shell, for general Stencil scripting.
        - Might need to define `stencil` objects.
- `Pen` 
    - Add remaining `GraphicsContext` methods, as needed.
    - [ ] Line types (dash, dot, solid, at least)
- `Stencil` 
    - [ ] Shapes
        - [ ] Arrowheads
        - [ ] Polygons
        - [ ] Rounded rectangles
    - [ ] Position support for relevant shapes
- [ ] Tcl bindings
    - Update `stencil` for `Stencil` class, as features are added.
    - [ ] `pen` for `Pen` class 
    - Enum commands?
- JTcl
    - Add helpers as needed by bindings.
    - [ ] Fork JTcl and simplify (it's too darn big!)
        - [x] Create minimal .jar by hand, to assess actual size
        - [ ] Run with it awhile, make sure it works.
