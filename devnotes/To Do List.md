- Next Steps
    - [x] Calendar definition Tcl extension
    - [x] Armorican Calendar
    - [ ] Fix bug in `day2yearDay`/`yearDay2day`.
        - These are implemented as default methods in `Calendar`.
        - They do not take the `BasicCalendar::epochOffset` into account.
        - Default methods cannot be called with "super".
        - Options
            - Option A: Copy methods to `BasicCalendar`, and modify.
            - Option B: Make epochOffset part of the `Calendar` API
                - Either support in `TrivialCalendar` or let it default to 0.
            - Option C: Make `Calendar` an abstract base class.
        - Add tests to `BasicCalendarTest` to ensure they are working correctly.
    - [ ] Calendar Tool prototype
    - [ ] Consider replacing `Calendar.MonthRecord` with `CalendarMonth`, a month record that includes both the name data and the length.
    - [ ] ScrollingCanvasPane widget
    - [ ] Prototype timeline charts.

    - [ ] Tree Diagram
- [ ] `pen` Application
    -   calendar tool
        - [ ] Basic tool, for exercising Calendar scripts
    -  `draw` tool
        - [ ] Execute multiple Tcl scripts, save PNG files
    - `view` tool
        - [x] Executes Tcl script, shows drawing
        - [ ] `pen view` tool displays the script text

    - `demo` tool
        - [x] Current test app runs as `pen demo`
        - [x] Pick from drawings done with Java API
    - [ ] Proper installation
    - [ ] `shell` tool â€” stretch goal
        - JTcl shell, for general Stencil scripting.
        - Might need to define `stencil` objects.
- `Pen` 
    - Add remaining `GraphicsContext` methods, as needed.
    - [ ] Line types (dash, dot, solid, at least)

    - [x] Save, restore, and transforms
    - [ ] Explicit background, used when clearing.  Defaults to white.
    - [ ] Shapes
        - [x] Arrowheads
        - [ ] Polygons
        - [ ] Rounded rectangles
    - [ ] Position support for relevant shapes
- [ ] Tcl bindings
    - Update `stencil` for `Stencil` class, as features are added.
        - [x] Add `stencil save` and `stencil restore`
        - [ ] Add `stencil boxedtext` command.
    - [ ] `pen` for `Pen` class 
    - Enum commands?
- JTcl
    - Add helpers as needed by bindings.
    - [ ] Fork JTcl and simplify (it's too darn big!)
        - [x] Create minimal .jar by hand, to assess actual size
        - [x] Run with it awhile, make sure it works.
