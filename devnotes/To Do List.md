- Any time
    - Review Javadoc
- Next Steps
    - [x] Add a `HistoryQuery` to `HistoryExtension`
    - [x] Add `HistoryFile`, a record including
        - `HistoryBank`
        - `HistoryQuery`
        - Optional `Calendar`
        - FIle `Path`
    - [x] Make `DataFiles.loadHistory()` return a  `HistoryFile`
    - [ ] Allow a history script can set up the default query, particularly the entity sorting.
    - Add entity sorting to `HistoryQuery`
        - `prime`: those entities that always go first (a pseudo-type)
        - `typeOrder`: the order for display of types: e.g., `{person place period}`
            - Sort other types alphabetically after these.
        - Within a type, sort by starting moment then by ending moment
    - Add query options to `pen history`'s command-line syntax. 
        - Add a copy constructor to `HistoryQuery` so that the tool can copy and modify the history's default query.
    - [ ] TextTimelineChart improvements
        - [ ] Complete box around periods.
        - [ ] (?) Use "heavy" lines for when drawing periods, light lines for everything else.
        - [ ] Grouping of entities by type; possibly a box around each type
    - [ ] Standard java "asserts" are not flagged as errors at runtime; add `Assert`.
    - Define `CalendarSet`
        - A set of related calendars, e.g., `armorican + cumbrian`.
        - The `CalendarExtension` should explicitly define a `CalendarSet`, not an individual calendar.
        - The `HistoryExtension` should load a calendar set, and then specify the calendar to use when creating events.
        - The `HistoryTool` (and any other clients) should be able to specify the calendar and date format to use for output.
    - [ ] Fix CalendarTool to load calendars using `DataFiles.loadCalendar`.
    - [ ] Fix CalendarTool to let you select from the calendars available.
    - [ ] Revise TimelineDiagram to display `History` data
        - [ ] Will require `HistoryExtension`
            - [ ] Build histories in Tcl
            - [ ] Load history file
    - [ ] Review and cleanup `MonthSpread` and `YearSpread`
- Diagrams
    - [[Timeline Diagram Initial Concept]]
        - [x] Flesh out `FundamentalCalendar`
        - [x] Add `SimpleCalendar`
        - [x] Define a preliminary `TimeLineDiagram` class
        - [x] Prototype a simple Time Line Diagram using Stencil
            - Add capabilities to Stencil as needed.
        - [x] Design `HistoryBase` data class
        - [x] Prototype text timeline diagram output using Unicode drawing characters.
        - [x] Draw text timeline charts with "fuzzy" SOFT caps
            - Draw SOFT caps one row up from top or down from bottom.
            - If there are SOFT caps in the top or bottom row, leave room.
            - Also, fix c0 setting; it's one too small when we're drawing the periods.
    - Calendar Charts
        - [ ] Add calendar definition and conversion Tcl extension
        - [ ] Add tool to define and output month and year calendars
        - [ ] Implement [[Regnal Calendars]]
    - [ ] Tree Diagram
- [ ] `pen` Application
    -   calendar tool
        - [ ] Basic tool, for exercising Calendar scripts
    -  `draw` tool
        - [ ] Execute multiple Tcl scripts, save PNG files
    - `view` tool
        - [x] Executes Tcl script, shows drawing
        - [ ] `pen view` tool displays the script text
        - [ ] Display read/eval errors in GUI, side by side with image.
    - `demo` tool
        - [x] Current test app runs as `pen demo`
        - [x] Pick from drawings done with Java API
    - [ ] Proper installation
    - [ ] `shell` tool â€” stretch goal
        - JTcl shell, for general Stencil scripting.
        - Might need to define `stencil` objects.
- `Pen` 
    - Add remaining `GraphicsContext` methods, as needed.
    - [ ] Line types (dash, dot, solid, at least)
- `Stencil` 
    - [x] Save, restore, and transforms
    - [ ] Explicit background, used when clearing.  Defaults to white.
    - [ ] Shapes
        - [x] Arrowheads
        - [ ] Polygons
        - [ ] Rounded rectangles
    - [ ] Position support for relevant shapes
- [ ] Tcl bindings
    - Update `stencil` for `Stencil` class, as features are added.
        - [x] Add `stencil save` and `stencil restore`
        - [ ] Add `stencil boxedtext` command.
    - [ ] `pen` for `Pen` class 
    - Enum commands?
- JTcl
    - Add helpers as needed by bindings.
    - [ ] Fork JTcl and simplify (it's too darn big!)
        - [x] Create minimal .jar by hand, to assess actual size
        - [x] Run with it awhile, make sure it works.
